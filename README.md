# üçΩÔ∏è Food Recipe Search App

## Overview

The **Food Recipe Search App** is a modern web application that allows users to search for recipes by ingredient or dish name. Built with React and Material UI, it provides a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface. The app fetches real-time recipe data from the [Edamam Recipe API](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api) and displays results in an elegant card-based layout. To securely handle API requests and avoid CORS issues, the app uses a Node.js/Express backend server as a proxy.
